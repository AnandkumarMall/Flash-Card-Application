Flash Card Application


Overview<br>
This is a simple flashcard application built using Python and Tkinter. <br>
It helps users learn a foreign language by displaying a word in the target language (French) and allowing the user to guess its translation in the source language (English).<br>

The application reads words from a CSV file (data/french_words.csv) containing French words and their English translations. <br>
The user's progress is saved to a separate CSV file (data/words_to_learn.csv).
